# Backlogger
**Capstone Project for Epicodus**  
**By Peter Grimm, 09.25.2020**

## Description
My capstone project for Epicodus. Backlogger is an application which allows users to keep track of their media backlogs. Users can add Movies, TV, video games, and books that they want to experience to their backlog, and prioritize and track their consumption of that media. This project is designed to showcase all the skills that I have developed over the past months working through the curriculum at Epicodus.
