## Work log
8am - Researching legality of web scraping for use in my stretch goals
11am - Researching and getting example payloads from my list of possible APIs
3pm - Down the rabbit hole researching book database APIs, may be challenging to deal with because of the sheer number of editions and foreign language versions. Not sure how to pick which ones from the API response to present to users.

## Decision log
* Will not pursue stretch goals via web scraping. While not illegal it seems that large corporations are still litigious in regards to it.
* TheTVDB API is locked behind a paywall for individual user access, development access goes through their licensing team. I'm going to set this one aside for now.
* IGDB is now a part of the Twitch API. Would prefer not to use this one.
