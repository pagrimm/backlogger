## Work log
8am - Researching legality of web scraping for use in my stretch goals
11am - Researching and getting example payloads from my list of possible APIs

## Decision log
* Will not pursue stretch goals via web scraping. While not illegal it seems that large corporations are still litigious in regards to it.
* TheTVDB API is locked behind a paywall for individual user access, development access goes through their licensing team. I'm going to set this one aside for now.
* IGDB is now a part of the Twitch API. Would prefer not to use this one.
