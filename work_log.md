## Work log
8am - Researching legality of web scraping for use in my stretch goals
11am - Researching and getting example payloads from my list of possible APIs

## Decision log
* Will not pursue stretch goals via web scraping. While not illegal it seems that large corporations are still litigious in regards to it
