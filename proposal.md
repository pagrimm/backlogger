## Name of Student: Peter Grimm

## Name of Project: Backlogger

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
An application to keep track of your media backlog. Always getting movie, TV, video game, and book recommendations from friends and want to keep track of them? You can with this app. Create a backlog of media, mark media watched/read/played when you're done. Set priority and create themed lists to organize your backlog.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
Users have a media backlog.
Users can add movies, TV shows, books, and video games to their backlog.
Users can filter backlog by media type (movie, TV, books, video games).
Users can set the priority of their backlog items.
Users can mark media items complete when they have finished them.
Users can create custom groupings to organize their backlog.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
C#/.NET
MySQL Database
Potentially a React front-end and C#/.NET back-end(tentative)
Bootstrap (and potentially React Bootstrap)

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Users can rate media and collective user rating is displayed for rated media.
Users can review media and user reviews are displayed for reviewed media.    
Users can browse curated lists of media (IMdB Top 500, AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies, Roger Ebert's Great Movies List, etc.)
Users can filter by other metadata than media type (genre, year, director, etc.)
Users can search a movie database to add movies
Users can search books database to add books
Users can search a TV database to add TV shows
Users can search a video game database to add TV shows
Users are presented links to streaming sites or online marketplaces that feature media they have added
Users are presented IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic scores for media they have added.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
OMDb or TMDb APIs for the movie search stretch goal.  
Google Books API for the book search stretch goal.
TheTVDB or TMDb APIs for the TV search stretch goal.
IGDB or RAWG APIs for the video game search stretch goal.
Finding user media on streaming sites is a challenge, none of the major streaming services offer public APIs anymore. Guidebox API is an aggregator of exactly this information but it is not free, still looking into alternative free solutions. Could potentially web scrape with Selenium (will necessitate some research into the legality).
IMdB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic do have APIs available but may not be free to use. Can potentially find much of this information mirrored in the other APIs listed. Still researching.

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
No, just looking forward to getting into the project.
